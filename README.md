# vapoursynth-Hysteria
Hysteria was originally made by Scintilla for Avisynth and published [here](https://www.animemusicvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=101471) (I think).

It was ported to VapourSynth by [Overdrive80](https://forum.doom9.org/member.php?u=163116) and posted on [doom9](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=172710).

I rediscovered it, fixed some issues so that it actually works now and added it to github for easier management.
